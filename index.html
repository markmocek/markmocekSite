            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are a few differences between the world of Terra and the standard 
                D&D world. Some of the ones that have come up or seem slightly more important are listed below, 
                but they are not necessarily all the differences.
            </p>
            <p>
                - The strongest beings are the brother gods Nahir and Melphas followed by the ArchAngels and Demon 
                Lords.
                <br>
                - All deities are either less powerful beings or a different interpretation of the great beings.
                <br>
                - Druids can touch metal, though they are not fond of the substance.
                <br>
                - Dragons are not a common sight. It is said that they were drove to extinction by dragon hunters 
                during the final stages of the War of Dragons. None have been seen since. Some say they never were.
                <br>
                - Magically inclined individuals are very rare due to the Mystic Wars and can be fewer than one 
                per several thousand people.
