            <a id="C1"><b><u>Stan Onheil</u></b></a>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stan Onheil was found, alongside Folwin, in the caves of a cult seeking to bring 
            powerful demons into the world of Terra. Stan has since revealed himself as a lord of the house Ravenpost 
            and has taken a seat on the council of Peryn.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stan began seeking adventurers and offering them treasures in exchange for helping 
            him collect a set of materials he believes will be necessary to save the mortal plane. He has managed to 
            attract many brave souls as well as the rare few magical users that still exist in Ebrua.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The city that Stan resided in, the city of Peryn, fell under attack by the Demon Lord 
            of Disease, Shax. Shax plagued the city and destroyed most of its population while Stan struggled to gather 
            heroes he believed to be capable of defending the city. When such heroes were found, he joined them in their 
            attempt to purge Shax and his followers. Unfortunately, zealots of the ArchAngel Imperius managed to summon 
            their deity to the mortal plane. Nearly all of the heroes Stan had assembled perished to the ArchAngel. Stan 
            himself suffered from the battle in unnatural ways that left his body wounded and unhealing. Stan has since 
            began to push harder for his vision of a world free of the other planes.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stan frequently warns of the Lords of the absolute planes, Heaven and Hell. He fears 
            their coming and pushes any adventurers he can find to help him fulfill his self proclaimed prophecy. He seeks 
            out "The Four" that will protect the plane from all who would seek to destroy or conquer it.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stan sits outside the ruins of his former city with a shadow of the strength he once 
            commanded. Many think him mad as the world descends into chaos around him. Armies rise around him in great 
            number with many of the holy orders joining groups who claim to fight for the justices of Heaven, those with 
            selfish desires joining various Demon Lords and their hosts, and the new order of the Crimson Crusade growing 
            rapidly in the southern regions of Ebrua. Stan sits outnumbered hundreds to one by even the smallest collection 
            seeking to take the continent for themselves, but he remains confident that his "Four" will be all he needs.

        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Folwin is an elf who was found with the human Stan in the caves of a demonic cult. 
            Folwin is gifted with some magical abilities and is able to allow people to relive events in history so long 
            as he has the original historical text. He currently resides in a base gifted by the council of Peryn and oversees
            the base's upkeep while the party is absent.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Folwin has since joined Stan's cause and assists him in his pursuit of "The Four" of 
            Stan's own prophesy. Folwin, being a historian, admits the he can find no historical mention of anything that 
            can link Stan's "Four"  to anything the people of the past have said or believed. Some of the adventurers have 
            asked why he follows Stan and his odd agenda and Folwin had responded, "I see no reason why Stan believes what 
            he does, but he believes so passionately. He is either mad or right, and I do not believe he is wholly mad."

            The items he crafts often have his name and the purpose of the items located somewhere on the items themselves. Unfortunately, 
            Arlen has not had the best luck and frequently creates items that do not work as fully intended. He still strives for greatness

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gavel was an ambitious and gifted Aasimar paladin. His master and mentor, LightLord Reynauld, seemed to look at him as 
            the son he never had and helped Gavel reach high in the paladin order despite his young age. During Gavel's travels, he came across a sentient 
            blade of the name Severance. Gavel took up the blade believing he would be able to cleanse the blade of its bonds and use it as a holy weapon 
            for his order. To Gavel's great regret, the blade used Gavel and the cleansing ritual merely released the presence within. Severance used it 
            power to dominate Gavel and begin amassing an army he refers to as The Crimson Crusade.

        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reynauld was a high ranking member of the Radiant Dawn, an order of paladins pledged to seek out and destroy the dark 
            creatures of the world. Reynauld was on path to become a Fist of Heaven, the rank of the greatest warriors of the light, when he came across 
            the Aasimar, Gavel. Reynauld ended up taking Gavel into the order and giving up his position in order to train the boy. Instead, Reynauld took 
            the rank of LightLord which allowed him to take on an apprentice full time. After years of mentoring, Reynauld let Gavel set out on his own in 
            order to prove himself as a full fledged member of the Radiant Dawn. During this time, Reynauld received a letter from Gavel in which he mentioned 
            a sentient sword and an altar known to few other than the paladins and clerics of Nahir. Reynauld was worried about the true motives of the sword 
            his apprentice referred to as Severance and quickly mounted his war horse and sped off to intercept Gavel. When Reynauld arrived, he was too late. 
            He found Gavel standing over the corpse of a beheaded woman. When Reynauld met his gaze, the eyes looking back did not match those of the boy he 
            had mentored. The creature who referred to itself as Severance attacked him. Reynauld could not bring himself to slay Gavel, even if it was not 
            truly him anymore, and offered his service instead. Severance seemed to be pleased by this and accepted.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reynauld looked for ways to free his apprentice as Severance began massing a large army that he referred to as the Crimson 
            Crusade. Reynauld watched as Severance sent echos of its consciousness into people to help control and ensure their devotion to his cause. Reynauld 
            tried subtle ways to try and test the influence Severance had over Gavel, but to no avail. After many failed attempts, Reynauld threw aside subtlety 
            and tried to overpower Severance with a spell bought from a shady merchant. Reynauld was overpowered almost instantly. It had seemed that the echos 
            that Severance put into his recruits could pull power from their bodies and lend it to Severance directly. Beaten, Reynauld prepared for Severance 
            to take his life. Severance, however, did not make any move towards Reynauld, just merely laughed and mocked his attempt. Severance gloated that 
            despite the ease in killing Reynauld, it would be better punishment to let Reynauld live knowing there was nothing he could do.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reynauld had descended into darkness. Even if he collected an army to cut down the Crimson Crusade, Severance would destroy 
            them. Severance had grown in power and was able to afflict groups of people with his influencing echos, turning armies to his cause during the fight. 
            If he were to have any chance, he would need an army that Severance could not turn against him. Then it came to him.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reynauld traveled to Peryn. He had heard that the city councilor, Stan, was calling for help to fight some demonic force. Help, 
            however, is not why Reynauld went to Peryn. He had heard of an exceptionally skilled craftsman by the name of Aldis. He went to Aldis and requested a 
            unique weapon. Aldis crafted it, a runed greataxe, capable of harnessing the power Reynauld planned to use to destroy the Crimson Crusade.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Reynauld left, after the Battle for Peryn, he headed for Stiria. Rumors of the Necromancer that had taken up dwelling was 
            one of the last pieces to his desperate plan. When he arrived at Stiria, the city seemed to be empty. He could feel the dark presence within, but the 
            Necromancer seemed to be hiding. He moved towards the center of the city where he caught a glimpse of the robed spellcaster. Reynauld immediately charged 
            him, but he was quickly intercepted by a horde of undead who seemingly came out of nowhere. Reynauld managed to fight them off, but lost his war horse. 
            He knelt by his animal, remembering when he first got it with Gavel after they lost their previous horses during one of their more dangerous missions. 
            After a brief moment, Reynauld charged back after the Necromancer and found him in the throne room of the castle he had fled into. The Necromancer threw 
            back his hood, revealing his gaunt face and sunken eyes. It was clear to Reynauld that this necromancer was a Lich, and a new one at that. He could sense 
            the Lich's phylactery was on him, a mistake no season Lich would ever make. Reynauld engaged and found that despite his shortcomings as a Lich, he was no 
            novice to spellwork. It took Reynauld longer than he would have liked to strike the killing blow, but eventually his new axe found purchase in the Lich's 
            thin form. As Reynauld stood over the Lich's body, he found himself hesitant to take the next step. He reached into his belt pouch and plucked the paper he 
            had read so many times before to remind himself why he must press on. He read the letter Gavel had sent him all those months ago. After reading it he took 
            his great axe and cut into the phylactery. The runed blade began to absorb the soul resting with. Reynauld could feel it binding into the weapon and, in 
            turn, into him. The power was nothing like he'd ever felt before. The darkness of it was unsettling at first, but he quickly overcame the feeling. Reynauld 
            looked down at his axe, the once empty runes now glowing a cold blue. He crumpled the letter that he still had in his hand and threw it at the lich before 
            walking out of the castle. On his way out, Reynauld came across the body of his war horse. He focused his new power and touched the dead horse. The horse 
            was not long dead and still had some warmth to it, but as the magic took effect all warmth quickly drained from it. The horse shuddered and then opened a 
            now slightly glowing blue eye. The horse lurched to its feet as the magic took full effect. Reynauld mounted it and looked to the horizon. "Now, to build 
            my legion."
