        </div>
        <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The god brothers Melphas and Nahir were the first beings to exist in the empty void. Desiring to create 
        something to give their endless existence a purpose and interest, the two each created a plane of existence.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Melphas created a dark plane he named Hell. Melphas poured some of his own power into his first five creations 
        creating Hell's Demon Lords. Each lord embodied aspects of an existence in Hell. The five great demons were Deumos, the lord of lust; 
        Haures, the lord of hate; Raum, the lord of lies; Shax, the lord of disease; and Uphir, the lord gluttony. Melphas then created hordes 
        of creatures for the demon lords to afflict and torture into twisted images of themselves creating lesser demons.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nahir created a plane of light referred to as Heaven. Like Melphas, Nahir poured some of his power into his first 
        creations, the Archangels. The first Arch Angel created was Adonael, the angel of purity. In addition to being the first creation of Nahir, 
        Adonael was also bestowed with more of Nahir's essence than his fellow Archangels Imperious, the angel of valor; Guriel, the angel of life; 
        Karael, the angel of peace; Hadriel, the angel of mercy; and Sidriel, the angel of justice. To accompany his Archangels, Nahir created a 
        host of lesser angels.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two brothers had created planes that spoke to the nature of the creator. Heaven, a world of peace and order. 
        Hell, a world of chaos and strife.

            <a id="E2"><b><u>Creation of Mortals: Year 0 Age Of Fahren</u></b></a>
        </div>
        <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Melphas and Nahir began to tire of the simplicity of their realms after eons with their creations. Knowing that alone 
        each would only be able to create variants of the same creation, the two brothers came together to create a third plane. This was the plane of mortals. 
        Unlike each of their original creations, the creatures of the mortal realm were not made of undying flesh. Mortals would eventually fall to death from 
        age, but their immortal soul would stay within the realm and be reborn.
	    <br>
	    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being children of both Melphas and Nahir, the mortals were capable of more than just darkness or light. Each being was a mixture 
	    of the two and often struggled in balancing its two halves. Enthralled with the success of their creation, the two gods created variations of the 
	    original race of mortals and shaped a world that matched their duality.
	    <br>
	    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mortals lived in peace and grew in number as they spread across the world created for them. Despite differences between 
	    them, there was acceptance.

        <div class="title2">
            <a id="E3"><b><u>Corruption of the Mortal Plane: Year 834 Age of Fahren</u></b></a>
        </div>
        
        <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After years of watching the mortals, Melphas started growing impatient. He wanted to see the darkness in the mortals. Melphas 
        wanted to see the power he placed inside of them, but the mortals seemed to actively strive for the qualities bestowed in them by Nahir. Melphas wondered 
        if his brother had not been fair in the balance of their creation. Why would Nahir place more of his essence in the mortal and create an imbalance if the 
        purpose of this realm was an equilibrium of their two powers? Melphas believed the only reason Nahir would cause an imbalance was to create a shift in 
        power. With the combined efforts of Heaven and the souls of  mortal world Terra, Nahir would be powerful enough to destroy Melphas. Enraged, Melphas 
        confronted Nahir.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nahir admitted to placing more of his essence into the creation of the mortals than was agreed upon, although Nahir did not do 
        so in order to become more powerful. Nahir believed that the mortal races would not prosper with an equal disposition for light and dark. In order to 
        move beyond a small group of people endlessly killing one another and fill their world, light needed to triumph.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Melphas was not convinced by his brother's explanation. Knowing the only way he could overcome Nahir was by harnessing the power 
        of the souls they worked together to create, Melphas linked the mortal world Terra to Hell. Unfortunately, the link was not strong and could only take souls 
        from Terra after the death of one of its inhabitants. Even then the soul had to be primarily dark, limiting Melphas to the mortals who had lived 
        lives more akin to his own creations. Nahir sensed the link that Melphas had made to Terra. Knowing what Melphas planned on doing with their joint creation, 
        Nahir opened his own link to Terra.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the links to Terra established, the reincarnation process was destroyed. Souls were no longer able to reenter the cycle 
        due to the links that pulled them upon death. Melphas once again felt cheated. Since the souls were comprised of more light than dark, Nahir was collecting 
        more souls than Melphas. Seeking a way to tip the balance back in his favor, Melphas turned his attention to the city of Maura.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maura was a small city where Melphas's darkness was most prevalent and the people there often indulged in their dark desires. Melphas came 
        to the people and told them that Nahir was planning to destroy him, and once he was gone Nahir would purge the world of the pleasures they had come to enjoy. 
        Melphas told them the only way to prevent this was to aid him in stopping Nahir. To better prepare for the tasks that would arise, Melphas endowed the people 
        with power from his realm of darkness. The people became stronger, but also acquired demonic features similar to those of Melphas's original creations. 
        Melphas called his mortal hybrids Tieflings and sent them to spread his darkness.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nahir was dismayed to find what Melphas had done to the mortals of Maura. He knew that the new race of Tieflings would be a threat 
        to not only the other races, but also to himself should Melphas become strong enough. In light of this, Nahir appeared to the city of Anora. The people of 
        this city were exceptionally zealous and eager to lend aid to the Lord of Light. Nahir bestowed angelic power within the people, creating the first Aasimar.

        </div>
        
        <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; War broke out between the followers of Melphas and those of Nahir. Cities were burned to ash as the magi of Melphas's army set fire to 
        their foes. Nahir's forces massacred thousands of people as they attempted to rid the world of people influenced by the darkness. Those who did not join a side 
        were accused of sympathizing with the enemy and were killed by both factions.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those feeling no connection to either side sought refuge from the conflict. The elves, the vast majority of which did not participate in 
        the war, built themselves a sanctuary called Sindarin to escape the war. As news of Sindarin spread to groups seeking an escape, the population of the city grew in 
        both number and diversity. Dwarves built vast networks for their kind beneath the foundation of the city while groups of gnomes, humans, and halflings blended 
        into the elven populous.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The war continued for years as both sides suffered losses of their god's chosen. Both factions were concerned when they discovered that the 
        Tieflings and Aasimar were unable to produce new generations of their kind. All attempted breedings resulted in the birth of more or less average humans. Realizing 
        that time was not on their side, due to the limited and dwindling number of Tiefling or Aasimar, paranoia set in. Each side feared the other would sway the neutral 
        inhabitants of Sindarin, which had a rapidly increasing population, to their side and decimate the other. In their apprehension, both sides attacked the city.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The initial strike devastated the city. Unprepared for such an assault, almost half of the city's surface populace died. Elven magi began 
        erecting barriers and wards to protect themselves from another attack while the surviving surface population was moved into the underground city of the dwarves. 
        After suffering such losses, the city would fare poorly against a continued attack from both sides. Despite the severity of the circumstance, the people of 
        Sindarin refused to subdue and join a group that had murdered so many of their people. A council, made up of a few members of each race, formed and elected to beg 
        the race of dragons and dragonborn that lived in the harsh elements of Ormarr for support.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people of Sindarin waited for an answer from Ormarr as the war they had tried so hard to escape was waged right on top of them. The 
        armies of Nahir and Melphas quickly returned to their fight with each other while simultaneously trying to finish off the destroyed city. Every one of Sindarin's 
        populous had either been killed or forced to hide within the dwarven tunnels. Those who did not die by the hands of the two warring armies started succumbing to 
        starvation and sickness. As the weeks turned to months, the recently formed council began to fear that their embassy never made it to Ormarr. Their numbers dwindled 
        to nearly a tenth of their original size when the Sindarin magi first heard word from the magi of Ormarr. The few of the remaining people that could fight prepared 
        for battle as the reinforcements from Ormarr drew near.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the Ormarrians arrived, the tides of battle quickly turned. The Sindarin people emerged from their sanctity beneath the ruins of Sindarin 
        to find a multitude of dragons and dragonborn descending on the city. Dragonborn warriors began driving back foot soldiers while dragonborn magi assaulted groups of 
        warriors belonging to Nahir and Melphas alike. While the dragonborn focused on those within the city, the dragons dealt with the armies on the outskirts. The massive 
        beasts cleaved hordes of warriors with their claws. Those who were not killed by claws were bombarded with an assortment of fire, ice, lightning, acid, and poison.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dragon and dragonborn forces extinguished the two armies in a matter of days, leaving those who managed to survive fleeing and hiding. 
        Unfortunately, the war had left the city of Sindarin in ruins. The remaining people left the city to rebuild somewhere new. Grateful to the dragons and dragonborn, 
        the council offered seats on the council and a hope for continued cooperation. Some of the dragons and dragonborn agreed and traveled with the people to help build 
        their new home. Most of them, however, chose to return to Ormarr. Eventually, the former people of Sindarin reached a location they believed would be suitable to 
        rebuild. Together the races constructed the city of Peryn.
