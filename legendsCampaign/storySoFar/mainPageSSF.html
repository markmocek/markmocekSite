        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The party found themselves in a cave with one door. The cave was poorly lit by some candles,
            on a table, in the center of the room. On that table was a piece of paper with colored circles drawn in various locations.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The group took the paper and entered the next room. In that room the party found a gnome, elf,
            human, orc, and tiefling standing near the far wall. The group attacked the opposing party. Genn, a man with wolf like
            qualities, engages in taunting the elf. Teah spent some of the battle looking for land mines, the hard way. The group quickly
            made use of the map they had previously discovered to avoid as many traps as possible. The spellcaster, D'Jango, used powerful
            magics against the enemy orc, ripping half of the orc's body apart.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the fight continued, Genn got close and personal with the elf Faelyn. Faelyn seemed to see something
            in Genn that caused some form of attraction. Genn returned this affection by mutilating Faelyn with his sword. In a fit of blind
            rage, the already wounded gnome attempted to leap at Genn with a land mine. Genn, who was holding Faelyn's lifeless body, barely
            managed to avoid the leaping gnome<font color="green">(CRITICAL 20)</font>. The gnome's face turned to horror as he collided with
            Faelyn, blowing their body parts all over the room. The tiefling, at seeing her party members die such horrific deaths, fell to her
            knees and sat there in shock.
             <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The group finished off the human who was still fighting and then finished off the devastated tiefling. Xavi
            healed some of D'Jango's injuries and began collecting body parts to bury the dead. The party decided to take a long rest.

            <a id="S2"><b><u>Session Two:</u></b></a>
        </p>
        <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teah found a piece of paper among the fallen enemy corpses. The document seemed to be a request to find a gem and
        included a map to a nearby town. The party decided to head for the town in hopes of finding and returning the gem to its owner, in return
        for a reward of course.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the party traveled to the town, they came across a circle where no plants were growing. The circle had a couple
        cow skeletons lined up in a row. The group decided to quickly move on towards the town.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon arrival, the group learned that some of the local livestock was strangely disappearing, and a boy who lived
        on a cattle farm near the edge of the village had seen something mysterious. Genn decided to investigate further and went to find the boy
        in question, with Xavi trailing behind.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D'Jango and Teah decided to go to the local inn where they met a barkeep named Fran. Fran, a woman of few words,
        gave the two keys to rooms on the second floor of the inn. Teah and D'Jango went up to their respective rooms where they discovered how
        incredibly disgusting the arrangements were. The beds had bugs and were just slabs of hay.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Genn and Xavi, now at the boy's home on the farm, knocked on the door. Xavi flew to the roof of the house while
        Genn stood waiting for the door to open. A man opened the door. Genn inquired about the boy who saw something taking people's livestock.
        The man, nervous at seeing a man with wolf like features, tried to close the door. Genn placed his foot in the doorway to prevent it from
        closing. Genn pushed at the door as the man tried to push it closed. Genn heard the man call someone over inside of the house. As Genn pushed
        inside, he heard what sounded like someone running away from the house. The man fell to the ground as Genn forced his way into the room.
        Genn then took the pommel of his sword and hit the man upside the head. The man stopped moving aside from the slow up and down of his chest
        as he breathed. Genn then struck the man a second time, splitting his skull. The man let loose a quick, violent shake and then lay still.
        Xavi flew down to check on the man who had brain matter exposed from the fatal blow. Genn then went back towards the town in search of the boy.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unable to find the boy, Genn went to the inn where he had a small encounter with the barmaid Fran. The encounter
        ended when she pulled a knife and gently poked the tip into Genn's armpit, drawing blood. Genn then went upstairs and kicked a hole in the
        door to D'Jango's room. Teah, seeing Genn with his foot stuck in the door, pushed Genn causing him to break through the rest of the door and
        onto the floor. After a brief scuffle, Genn decided to sleep on D'Jango's floor while D'Jango and Teah went downstairs.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xavi, now back in town, watched a house where the boy had run to hide. Teah, meanwhile, went and stood outside the inn.
        A group of seven armed villagers left the house where the boy had gone and went towards the cow farm. Xavi and Teah followed.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After discovering the man's corpse, the village militia took his body to bury him. At this time, Teah and Xavi appeared
        at the house. Teah informed the militia that a wolfman that may have caused the death is currently at the village inn. The militia moved to
        apprehend the man she mentioned. Xavi stayed behind while Teah followed the militia back.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back in town, the militia go to the room where Genn was staying and ask him to come with them. Genn agrees and peacefully
        follows the militia back to a house. Genn was then placed in a small cell in the basement of the house.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, Xavi sees a creature going after the cows on the farm. Xavi uses magic to scare the deformed ugly creature,
        who then run into the forest. Xavi follows it to a clearing where two demonic creatures are sacrificing animals. Xavi spots a red gem and steals
        it by distracting the demons with a wall of water. Xavi begins running out of the forest with the gem.

        <p>
            <a id="S3"><b><u>Session Three:</u></b></a>
        </p>
        <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xavi continued to run from his demon pursuers. Attempting to lose them and head for town, Xavi decided to hide among the
        branches of a tree. This worked for the smaller demon, but the two large ones were able to sense Xavi and the stone he carried. While the demons
        started searching the nearby area, Xavi used magic to cause a small distraction which allowed him to escape back to the town.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, Genn remained in the cell beneath house. One of the militia, an older man named Hector, came down to discuss
        the death of the cow farmer. Genn attempted, without success, to deceive Hector with poorly constructed fabrications. Hector decided that it was
        in his best interest to get a confession before dealing with punishments, so he brought Teah and D'Jango to the house for questioning.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xavi arrived at the town just as the rest of the group was about to be questioned. Xavi noticed the smaller demon on the
        outskirts of the town looking for him. Xavi decided to mess with the small demon. Using magic, Xavi harassed the creature until to ran back off
        into the woods. Xavi then sat just outside the window of the house where the party awaited questioning.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hector questioned the group while a new man stood nearby. The man was not wearing armor, but instead had a crisp white
        tabard and a simple sword. The tabard had a picture of an orc, that looked less gruesome than most orcs, with what seemed like rainbow mist coming
        from its eyes. Unhappy with the results of the questioning, Hector decided to push harder to put the group against themselves. Hector told the group
        that he would execute someone for the crime and he was no longer worried who received the punishment. He also told the group that the small boy in
        the room with them had information to give regarding the murder. The group made remarks that brought the boy to tears before attempting to cast
        <i>Suggestion <font color="red">(14)</font></i> on Hector so he would let them go to the house by themselves. Hector decided that going to the house
        might not be such a terrible plan.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hector brought the group, the man in the white tabard, and the boy to the farm to "help investigate" the murder. While there
        Genn claimed to hear a noise near the treeline. Unconvinced, Hector let Genn walk with the man in the white tabard. Xavi who was previously eluding a
        militia man followed the group to the farm and sat on the roof holding the red gem he had recovered earlier.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now alone, Genn being outside and the boy being in another room of the house, Hector went for a hail Mary. Hector offered Teah
        and D'Jango money to kill Genn while Xavi played with the dark magic inside of the gem.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Genn started walking back towards the house and, sensing an opportunity, quickly took the sword belonging to the man in the white
        tabard. Genn simultaneously slashed him across the chest while pulling the sword from its sheath on the man's hip. The group, along with Hector, ran outside
        to see what was happening. Genn stood over the man, whose tabard began to turn red from the wound on his chest, while shouting "He attacked me, I defended
        myself!" Teah drew her bow as the man stood up infront of Genn. The man held out his hand as the sword vanish from Genn’s hand and reappeared in his own.
        Then man then closed his eyes as his clothing began to glow with white power. With a quick flash the cloth clothing was replaced with plate armor and the
        one-handed sword with a larger two-hander. Teah fired an arrow at Genn as the man prepared for combat.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a large demon came out of the forest. It was one of the two that had been pursuing Xavi. The now armored man turned to
        face it as Hector charged the beast. Xavi, now intoxicated with the magic of the gem, began creating magic writings in the sky and a magical fountain. Genn
        took the moment of distraction to flee into the forest, where he ran into the second of the two demons. The first demon moved towards the advancing Hector
        and shoved its massive fingers into his chest. Hector's cried quieted as his body began to wither as though the very essence of his life were being drained.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xavi, seeing the magic flowing within the demons as possible fuel for his new gem, hugged the demon. Sensing the gem, the demon pulled
        the small pixie, Xavi, from his head and began beating him into the ground. Seeing the power of the demon, Teah fled from the fight.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D'Jango moved into the house and positioned himself near the window facing the demon, who was still beating Xavi. D'Jango then fired
        off some spells, hitting the demon. The demon did not stop. It beat Xavi to the point of death, and then absorbed the small creatures magic into the gem that
        it had reclaimed. Finished, it turned its sights to D'Jango. As the demon crashed through the side of the house, D'Jango cast <i>Invisibility</i> and fled the
        fight. Genn, who was in the forest being chased by the second demon, eventually outpaced the demon and fled the fight as well.

        </p>
        <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our new party is heading down a road looking for a town. The party consists of Halt, a nobleman and archer; Selene, Halt's loyal bodyguard
        and a cleric; Dax, a bard; and Kurzick, a revenant and a blood hunter.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the party walks down the path, a man walks up to them. He tells them to turn back for there is nothing but danger ahead. The party,
        seeing a chance to save the day, head towards the town.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On their way to the town, the sky began to darken. The group looked up at the unnaturally appearing clouds just as a beam of light broke
        through above the nearby town. There was a bright flash and the party saw an angelic figure suddenly appear and descend on the town. With another bright flash, the
        figure disappeared along with the dark clouds.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking back to each other, Selene realized that everyone was devastated by the explosion of light<font color="red">(CRITICAL 1)</font>.
        Her party members were torn to shreds, but seemed to be in so much shock that they acted as if nothing was wrong. Selene tried to help the party only to eventually
        discover that there was nothing wrong with them. Selene cast <i>Remove Curse lvl 4</i> to return her vision to normal.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the party reached the town it was completely destroyed. Buildings were burning and bone that seemed to have been burned clean, despite
        a lack of black ashe. The party moved past the town and into the nearby forest only to discover a severely wounded demon. The party made quick work of it with Selene
        only accidentally shooting a party member<font color="red">(CRITICAL 1)</font> once with her crossbow and Kurzick finishing off the demon.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the demon dead, the party decided to try and find where it came from. Some tracks were found and the party began following them deeper
        into the forest. Halt, tired with the loud and slow pace of his allies, decided to pull off and find the demon's origin on his own. Unfortunately, some cultists were
        searching for possible sacrifices and found Halt. They knocked him out and took him to one of their sacrificial circles.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest of the party quickly discovers Halt's absence and tries to find him. Their search bring them to a cave entrance where they hear
        chanting. The party enters the cave to find a group of cultists chanting over six people who seem to be unconscious. Seeing that Halt is one of them, the party burst
        into action and kill all but one of the cultists. While the group interrogates their captured cultist, Kurzick examines the dagger of power he found on the cultist
        performing the sacrifice. The dagger almost seems to have a consciousness as he holds it in his hands<font color="red">(CRITICAL 1)</font>. Meanwhile, the captured
        cultist seems to be incredibly unitelligent and is killed by a powerful blow to the head from Selene's warhammer. The party decides to take this opportunity to rest.

        <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The party awakens and decides to travel deeper into the caves to try and find any other cultists that may be lurking in its many caverns.
        The first area they enter is full of chained people and animals. They all look to be dead or near death based on physical appearance, however
        they seem to be alive with solid black eyes. Halt shoots one in the head killing it while Kurzick stabs another with his newfound dagger.  Selene decides to take one
        of the corpses as a friend, resurrecting it into undeath and calling it Fred.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The group continues through the caves until they reach a room where people seem to be mindlessly mining a clear white gem. Some members of the
        party take this opportunity to take as many of these gems as they can carry. A few rooms later Dax discovers a cloak with the word "Invisibility" stitched into it.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The party eventually find themselves at a door with a sliding peephole. The party opens it to find a pair of black eyes looking back at them.
        The door is opened and battle ensues. The creatures seem similar to the ones that were chained, albeit a little more aggressive and physically capable. The party killed
        them all, with Dax taking out a great many with a powerful fireball, and continued through the caves.

        <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The party comes across a room filled with scrolls and writings. Everyone takes time to investigate the area and read some of the writing. It is
        here that Halt discovers what seems to be a magic ring with the word "Teleportation" written on it. After collecting any writing that seemed to be of note, the party progressed to the next room.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next room appear mostly empty aside from what seemed like an angel on a table. There was another table nearby the angel that had a large
        red gem with some kind of black smoke swirling within. Both Halt and Kurzick<font color="red">(CRITICAL 1)</font> touched the gem only to find themselves possessed by
        whatever was inside. Thinking quickly, Dax and Selene decided to use Selene's divine abilities to smite out the demons. The makeshift exorcism seemed successful as both
        Halt and Kurzick stopped their odd behavior.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kurzick, recently freed from possession, tried to pull a similar red gem from the back of the dead angel only to have it lurch to life. Selene used her
        warhammer to finish off the angel, who was barely hanging on to life, as it seemed to be corrupted by the gem.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The party pushed through the rest of the cultist's lair until they came upon a room where a man in a hood stood over two unconscious people. There was a
        strong darkness coming from the open portal that hovered in the air above the cultist. Halt used the cultist's concentration on the portal to line up a powerful shot. The arrow
        ripped through the cultist who turned round immediately. The wound from the arrow seemed to devastate the creature's physical form as its features turned from human to demonic in nature.
        The cultist began to cast a spell at Halt's feet only to have it <i>Counterspelled</i> by Dax. The portal began to shift and sputter as the cultist's distraction caused it to lose power.
        The party then beat the cultist until only lumps of flesh and blood remain.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The portal seemed to close as soon as the life left the cultist and within moments the elf awoke. Looking for a way to thank the party for saving him, Folwin,
        the elf, used a spell to allow the party to closely experience the historical War of Purity.

        <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The party experience a piece of The War of Purity as though they were the angels themselves. The angels are descending on a mortal city that seems to be filled with all
        variations of the mortal races. The six Archangels Adonael, Imperious, Guriel, Sidriel, Hadriel, and Karael quickly sensed the taint of demons among the mortals. They decide to split up to close
        the portals as soon as possible, with Adonael taking on the largest portal.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imperious and Sidriel quickly headed to one of the portals to find hordes of demons and two of the Lords of Hell stepping through the portal. Luckily the great demons were
        still incredibly weak from pushing themselves through the portal and were quickly dispatched. Guriel and Karael quickly dealt with their portal and the Lords of Hell that were coming through it.
        Hadriel, who braved his portal alone, also managed to close a portal and destroy a forming Lord of Hell before it was able to completely enter the mortal plane.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was as the Archangels closed the portals that they realized that they could no longer feel Adonael’s presence. The five quickly flew to the large portal that Adonael had
        gone to. With the portal, the largest of all the ones in the city, still open and leaking demons, the Archangels decided to take the battle to Hell.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once through the portal, the Archangels felt a glimmer of Adonael's presence. Unfortunately, there was also a legion of demons pressing towards them along with the remnants
        of the Lords of Hell. Seeing no other choice, the Archangels began fighting off the demons. Angels poured in from the portal to the mortal plane and fell into rank among the five great Archangels.
        Each angel killed many demons before falling, but the angels were greatly outnumbered. The power of the Archangels allowed the holy army to hold off the demons and that final glimmer of Adonael vanished
        from the Archangel's awareness. It was at this moment that an even larger collection of demons could be seen marching towards the fight.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Archangels chose to pull back before they were completely overrun. The Archangels manned the opening of the portal as the lesser angels began making their escape back to the
        mortal plane. During the fight at the portal, the encroaching demonic army made contact with the remaining angels. The Archangels prepared to leave when they noticed a familiar figure flying towards them.
        It appeared to be Adonael, although somewhat battered and discolored. He appeared to have black wings instead of the stark white of his fellow Archangels. His white and gold armor also seemed to be darker
        and damaged. Fearing his safety, Karael flew out to Adonael so she could help him escape. Upon reaching Adonael, he grabbed her and dragged her to the ground. The other Archangels, surprised by the sudden
        act of aggression prepared themselves for whatever may follow. Adonael, still holding Karael by the throat, looked to his fellow Archangels. His eyes, which were a bright blue, now shone with a dark red.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adonael stated that the their quest to keep out the darkness has always been pointless and was futile since the disappearance of their father Nahir. He said that Melphas has given
        him even more power, a new name of Asmoday, and they should join him. They refused and Karael told Asmoday to have faith that Nahir would return. Asmoday seemed annoyed by her call for faith and lifted his
        sword. Seeing this act of aggression, Hadriel quickly put his protection on Karael. Incredible pain filled Hadriel's body as he felt the pain meant for Karael. Asmoday smirked, and told Hadriel that his power
        was futile to protect anyone, least of all Karael. Hadriel felt his protective connect lift from Karael's form as Asmoday drove his sword back into her body. White angelic blood started dripping off the blade
        that was protruding out of Karael's back. She looked to the four remaining Archangels and use her remaining strength to send them through the portal and close it.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The party felt themselves being pulled back out of the vision and to Folwin’s side. There were not sure how long it had been, but just as they were returning the human that was lying
        to Folwin under the portal seemed to be waking up. He said his name was Stan.

        <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The party, now with the human Stan and historian elf Folwin, began to head out of the cave. During their treck out, Kurzick splits off and hears a mysterious sound near where they left the
        corpse of the corrupted angel. Kurzick slowly enters the room to find an angel, clad in solid gold armor and a massive golden spear, picking up the corrupted angel. Kurzick turned to run as the golden angel hurled its
        spear at Kurzick. He tried to evade the angel, but eventually was caught. The angel took its spear and drove it through Kurzicks chest. Kurzick blacked out.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The party, hearing a commotion from the other room, went to investigate. They found Kurzick and decided to leave the cave with haste. Once out of the cave, the party inquired about Stan's background.
        Stan claimed to be a lowly blacksmith. The group started heading for the closest city to their current location.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Along the path to the large city of Peryn, the group came across two men on a small bridge. One of the men attempted to stop Kurzick, who decided to walk across the bridge, only to be instantly thrown
        off. When the other went to try the same, Kurzick threw him into the river running beneath the bridge. The two men, now wet and next to the bridge, take out their short swords. Halt fires an arrow that goes through the knee
        of one of the men. The arrow, being magical, explodes and removes most of the man's leg. Stan smiles as Halt's arrow instantly incapacitates the man. Kurzick catches the other man, who was attempting to run, and stabs him with
        the cultist's dagger. The group begins to head back to the road while Halt and Dax stay to talk with the now crippled man. They end up killing him and taking a very nice dagger. The dagger has a symbol with what looks like two
        daggers in front of a smoke cloud. The dagger is of high quality and has powerful poisons with it.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The group reunites and travel for a little while before they take a break. Stan goes off into the forest to use the restroom while Halt sneakily follows him. Halt watches and Stan defecates and returns
        to the group. The group inquires about the odd "magic" items they found in the cave. Folwin tells of an elven man that wanted to create the most powerful magical items but was only able to make crappy versions. He said the elf's
        name was Alren and he usually wrote what the item was supposed to do somewhere on the item.

        <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The party comes across a carriage driver named Bran. The group use Bran’s service to hasten their travel to the city of Peryn. During the ride things get heated between Stan and Halt. Halt begins by threatening
        Stan at arrow point. When Stan does not cower, but instead finds Halt’s animosity amusing, Halt fires the arrow. The arrow is blocked by Selene’s shield and Halt makes a change of plan. Halt switches straight from attempting to murder
        Stan to trying to seduce him. Things don’t go well and Kurzick, who is sitting alongside Bran in the driver’s seat, thrusts his sword into the carriage and cuts Stan’s side.
	    <br>
	    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After more threats are exchanged between Halt and Stan, Halt leaps from the carriage and slightly wounds his ankle. Stan leaves the carriage as well, opting to walk the rest of the way to Peryn. Kurzick gives
	    Bran the life stealing dagger that he acquired in the cult’s caves. The party makes it to Peryn. Halt and Selene spend the night in one of the city’s nicer inns while Dax sleeps in a common inn after playing songs for the people.
	    Kurzick sleeps outside by the stables, for he is poor.
	    <br>
	    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next morning Dax awakens to find a blood covered body in the bed with him. He sneaks out of the inn to seek help from his party. The group discovers Stan has made it to the city and is now garbed in the
	    cloths of a nobleman. Stan explains that he was fortunate enough to stumble on people from his home town of Ravenpost. Guards inquire to the blood coming from Dax’s room in the inn and Stan assists Dax in deterring the guards.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stan help Dax deal with moving and hiding the body of the mystery man left in his bed. Once complete, the party heads to the council to offer a helping hand in the recent death of their council member. The party
        believes that the council member was killed by a prostitute after using Selene’s ability to commune with the dead.
	    <br>
	    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The group splits to search for information and collect resources. Halt sneaks into the council member’s personal quarters and takes valuables he can find, the most notable being gems from a dwarven chest. Halt
	    then goes to one of the town’s jewelcrafters and sells the jewels he strole. Once he finishes, Halt kills the elderly jewelcrafter and carves the assassin’s symbol from the dagger into the shop’s floor before setting fire to the building.
	    Halt then goes to a weapon shop and discovers a rare elven longbow, which he purchases.
	    <br>
	    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The group then reforms, except for Kurzick who stays near the council and wanders the halls. The group heads to a brothel where they interrogate the workers and managers. The party discovers that there is a
	    nobleman renting out a suite and the woman who usually services the council. The party prepare to enter and confront the nobleman. Stan, wearing some armor and a weapon, sees Kurzick and invites him on a secret adventure.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The group confronts the nobleman in the brothel. They quickly discover that he planned on gaining access to the council by killing off its members. The is attacked by the nobleman’s prostitutes who are revealed to
        be succubi. Stan arrives at the brothel with Kurzick and charges in. Kurzick leaves as soon as Stan enters the building. Stan joins the party for their fight against the demons. Dax manages to charm the male succubus and affectionately named
        him “boy toy.” Halt opens another room to discover a larger demon who enters the fight. The party manages to defeat the demons and they kill the nobleman. The part also sets fire to the brothel.
	    <br>
	    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the rest of the party is  fighting, Kurzick sees smoke in the city. He wanders over to discover guards around a partially burnt jewel shop. Scanning the crowd, Kurzick spots a suspicious man cloaked in dark purple.
	    <br>
	    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the party leaves the burning brothel, they are met by city guards. The guards begin to question the party when Halt tells of the demons that were within the brothel. Halt then reveals the disguised “boy toy” as a
	    demon and escapes into the crowd. The guards stab the demon with their spears killing it.
	    <br>
	    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Halt goes to another jewelcrafter in the city. After conducting some business with the dwarven jewelcrafter, Halt kills him. Halt then leaves the assassin’s symbol etched in the back door with the words “Be warned,
	    change is coming” and sets the building on fire. Halt visits one more jeweler who he sells the jewels stolen from from the other shops. He leaves her unharmed. Halt then purchases a horse and carriage before visiting a brothel. Once in the
	    brothel, Halt pays for all of the workers to gather in a single room. Once collected, Halt begins killing them all. He then moves to check the other rooms and discovers a total of three men who are using the brothel’s services. He makes them
	    leave the brothel and then finishes off the remaining workers. Halt takes the time to etch the assassin’s symbol into each door along with the warning “Be warned, change is coming” which he wrote in draconic scripts. Halt then leaves the building

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selene and Dax take the dead succubus’s body to an alley. Selene uses <i>Speak with Dead</i> to commune with the demon. They discover that the demon was responsible, at least in part, for the body that appeared in Dax’s bed.
        The two learn that the person was a member of the house of Ravenpost before the spell ended.
	    <br>
	    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selene then went off to train on her resilience while Dax worked on an antidote for the poison he had acquired with his assassin’s dagger. Dax then goes to the council and takes the dwarven council member to the dwarven
	    jeweler, who had been killed by Halt previously that day.
	    <br>
	    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The party inquired about the reward promised to them by the council. Stan volunteers to pay the party from his own pocket and announces his placement as the newest member of the council, replacing the man murdered by the
	    demons. Stan also informs the group that construction of a base of operation for the group has begun and would be ready within the week. The party goes to their respective inns to sleep.
	    <br>
	    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dax spoke with Stan before retiring to his own inn for sleep. Stan told Dax of his home in Ravenpost. Dax offered to teach the people there various arts, to which Stan seems pleased. Stan told Dax that he had some shipments
	    heading to Ravenpost the next morning and he would be grateful if Dax accompanied them. Dax agreed to go and teach the people of Stan’s home town.
	    <br>
	    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Halt is woken in the middle of the night to find a fresh cut on his arm and a trio of hooded figures in his room. Two of the figures, roughly the size of an average human, stand quietly by the door. The third hooded figure
	    was much shorter and seated at the desk in the room. The smaller figure addressed Halt and a small red light could be seen coming from under the figure’s hood whenever it spoke. In a very deep voice the figure told Halt that his antics throughout
	    the city were not appreciated. It told him that Halt would payback the wrongs he had done through services to the guild and, to ensure his cooperation, Halt had been poisoned. The figured told Halt that so long as he followed orders, the temporary
	    antidotes would be supplied. The figures took some of Halt’s gold for the trouble he caused them and left.
	    <br>
	    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Halt and Selene were notified by Folwin to meet in the basement of their inn. There they learned of Dax’s travel to Ravenpost and noted the disappearance of their companion, Kurzick. They were met by two new companions,
	    the elf spellcaster Elfy-Elf and the troll Korvak. Folwin told the party that demonic encounters were not a good sign and that it might mean that the link to Heaven and Hell might be strengthening. Folwin explained that the only way to fight off
	    the powerful creatures that would enter Terra was with weapons of great power. Folwin had discovered a book that spoke of weapons capable of destroying angels and demons alike, but lacked the materials to construct them. Folwin told the party where
	    they could find the needed materials, along with some missions that the council of Peryn wanted the party to assist with. The party decided to go for the <b>Shifting Lightning</b> item and help the city of Stiria along the way.
	    <br>
	    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before departing, Halt and Selene went to an alchemy shop in search of supplies and possibly revenge. Halt used his <i>Theives cant</i>  and discovered that the shopkeeper was willing to deal more than the average goods
	    displayed. Halt, worried that the alchemist may be aligned with the assassins that met with him the previous night, threatened the shopkeeper. The shopkeeper told Halt to leave and pulled a dagger to defend himself. Halt left and looped around to
	    the shop’s rear entrance. Halt snuck to the personal quarters on the second floor and then tried to kill the shopkeeper, who was visible from Halt’s position on the stairs. Halt failed to kill the man and the two quickly entered combat. The shopkeeper
	    was surprisingly resilient. Halt ended up killing the man with the help of Selene. The two then went to leave the shop. As Selene stepped out of the shop, she noticed a guard standing next to the door. Halt went to leave the shop from the rear exit
	    only to run into a man in a purple cloak, who was entering the back of the shop. The man seemed to recognize Halt and quickly incapacitated him. Selene examined the guard and found that he had been killed. The guards body had been propped up against
	    the wall with wire to that it appeared as though he were standing guard. Selene noticed that Halt had not yet joined her and when behind the shop to look for him. She saw the purple cloaked man walking away with Halt thrown over his shoulder. She attacks
	    the cloaked man. The man quickly drops Halt and runs off into the crowded city. Selene heals Halt and takes him back to the inn.

        around the city. Halt mentions that the dwarven councilor may have had something to do with the jewel shops. Stan takes note and promises to look into it. The group heads out.
	    <br>
	    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During their travels to Stiria the group discovered a small squirrel under attack of a hawk. The group ignored it,  possible due to either a love of hawks or a hate for squirrels. The group later came across a dwarf and samurai.
	    The two wanted to be paid for allowing the party’s wagon to pass. The group refused and battle ensued. The party seemed to be beating the duo when two more of the bandits appeared. These new two claimed to be the brothers of the dwarf and human that the
	    party had killed. The dwarf was thick and heavily muscled while the human was wearing leather armor and held a katana. The party engaged the two in combat. They were significantly tougher than their respective brothers. The party managed to triumph
	    due to the <i>Banish</i> spell used by Elfy, but Halt lost his life.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Halt entered a dark area as the life left his body. In this place was a cloaked figure in a seat made of bones. Behind the figure seemed to be a golden staff, but it seemed faded and forgotten. The figure's body was covered with
        a faded grey cloak. As Halt stood there, the figure tilted its head. Halt felt a strong hand grasp his shoulder as he was pulled from the room. Halt woke up on the ground as Selene used her abilities to bring Halt back from death.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Halt began to feel ill as the group continued their travel. It was at this point that he realized that the poison inflicted on him by the purple figures was starting to take effect. While trying to figure out a way to deal with
        the effects of the poison, the party noticed riders gaining behind them. The riders were quickly gaining on the party and appeared to be wearing two different colored hoods. The one closest to the caravan was wearing a familiar dark purple hood, while
        the one trailing behind was wearing a dark red. The two caught up to the part and began fighting. Unsure on what to make of the situation, the part stopped and prepared to fight. Halt shot an arrow at the purple hooded assassin, catching him in the knee.
        The red hooded assassin then sprinted after the purple one, who was now trying to flee, and tackled him. The red assassin began repeatedly stabbing the purple in the chest until he was satisfied that the other was dead.
	    <br>
	    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The party approached the red assassin. The man said his name was Davit and that he was part of The Sarasota Assassins guild. He also stated that the purple man was of the Mogiz assassins guild. Davit explained that the Mogiz
	    seemed to have a thing for killing noblemen and that the Sarasota did not appreciate it since that is where most of their contracts came from. Korvak, learning that the dead assassin was probably after Halt, took this opportunity to stomp the dead man's
	    upper body with his foot. Halt told Davit that he would gladly pay him for an antidote. Davit collected some poison from the dead assassin’s remains and constructed a temporary antidote for Halt to use until he could make a better one. Davit rode off to
	    prepare for any Mogiz that he hoped would be following Halt.
	    <br>
	    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The party continue traveling again and made it to the outskirts of the city of Stiria. While traveling, they noticed the large groups of people seemed to be leaving the city. The party discovered a small home that seemed to have a
	    blacksmith's shop. The group approached the smith who called himself Aldis. The group inquired about the state of the kingdom. Aldis told the group that he did not believe the king was an evil man, but something was causing him to execute common criminals
	    for lesser crimes. Aldis promised he would make something special for the group if they managed to help the kingdom without killing its king, Galen.
	    <br>
	    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The group then entered the city, except for Korvak who remain in a nearby wooded area, and witnessed the king's executions. The party noted that the king executed the criminals himself and did so with a swords that gave off an
	    undead presence. The part went to an inn to rest and prepare for whatever would come next. Selene began gambling with some people in the inn. Elfy pulled out his dragon chess set and entered a battle of strategy with one of the people within the inn. Halt
	    tried to pickpocket a man sitting at the bar. Unfortunately, he was discovered and taken by the guards to the city prison in preparation for the next execution.
